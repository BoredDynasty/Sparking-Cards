# Sparking Cards!

> [!TIP]
> I'm packaging some of the Modules in the game! So that you will be able to use them.
> 
> I'm starting to learn normal Lua now. Do you see those ``requires`` wrapped in strings? Those are packages and libraries, like *Discordia*.
>
> Better sound effects and music is underway!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ``2024/10/13`` | I've refurbished the game to be more performant!
>
> By removing a ton of unnecessary scripts, the performance went up to an all time high! Thats not all, the *UI* finally started to work.
> Why didn't I think of this before?
>
> By my estimate, the *PostClass* was making the game unperformant. And it seemed like the entire game was running solely on the PostClass aswell;
> Don't use HTTPService guys!

> I'm also tryna fix the whackass DataStore system. It's already good enough, but it could be better. *Maybe I should package it in the future? ðŸ“¦
>
> Oh and one more thing, once I learn how to make cutscenes, abilities, and a good Match Making system, this game will quickly start to finish up.
