# SPARKING CARDS!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ``12/4/24`` | I've refurbished the game to be more performant!
>
> The fighting part of the game is almost done! Each attack/ability will have its own separate module.
>
> I'm currently pulling free models from the toolbox for the abilities (I can't make VFX myself:sob:)
>
> With that out of the way, the UI is inspired by smash bros just a little bit. This will be familiar to Smash players (If anyone playing *plays* Smash.)
