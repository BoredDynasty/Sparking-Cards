# Sparking Cards!

> [!TIP]
> The next update is the full release!
> 
> Also, I'm packaging some of the Modules in the game! So that you will be able to use them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Game is currently unplayable, I'm testing some things that'll be crucial for the game and me.

> I'm starting to learn normal Lua now. Do you see those ``requires`` wrapped in strings? Those are packages and libraries, like *Discordia*.
